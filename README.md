# task_mgr_api
This project is a full, incremental implementation of a production-ready To-Do management system built using Python, SQLite/PostgreSQL, and a structured release plan. It demonstrates how to design secure REST APIs, implement authentication flows, manage data with clean schema design, and build both CLI and Web interfaces.
